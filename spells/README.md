## Spell Naming Conventions
Prefix: 'spells-sg_'
 'spells', This is required for spells to function. If the parent folder doesn't have this prefix no spell in the folder will function regardless of naming conventions.

Main: 'Spell-Name'
 Don't use **space** or **underscore** when inserting a gap into the spell name, Use a **dash**.

Suffix:
 '_Test', Not for server use. May include example spells.
 '_WIP', Aka work in progress
 '_A0', Add this if a spell with the same name exists from 0 to 9. After A9 start over from 0 but change the letter to the next one in the alphabet (A0 =1, B0 =11, C0 =21, D0 =31, etc).
